# World_Weather_Analysis

In this analyis, we set up a user entered minimum and maximum perferred temp to search through a randomized list of cities. Using the Google Maps API, we were able to get the locations for these cities by Lat and Lng and monitor their real time weather. Based off what the user entered, we would find a hotel in their perferred cities and show them with markers on a map.
